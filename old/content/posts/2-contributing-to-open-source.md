A very leading question in the title and the answer is, of course! Nobody said you had to commit code to be part of an open source project, many people commit changes to documentation and this is where my second open source pull request(PR)/ commit lies. I was recently working on a project which is using the Prism Library (https://github.com/PrismLibrary), a MVVM Framework for Xamarin Forms and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation).

While reading the documentation to build up and add features for our application, I found a very simple typo in the documents which irked me a bit. The document simply said ” batterly” instead of “battery” which is small but also means it takes 30 seconds to fix. So this is exactly what I did. Jumped over to the repository, navigated to the document and clicked the little icon that looks like a pencil in the top right corner (image below).

I then made the change, and hit the big green propose file change button at the bottom.

And then I had to accept the .Net Foundations Contribution Licence Agreement, seems scary but it is a form which asks a few questions and basically gets your signing to say you are allowed to contribute to the work.

So, no code and yet another PR accepted and under my belt. This is also a nice way to show the documentation is being used; if not for reading this to learn about the product and how to use it for this particular project, it may have stayed unnoticed for some time.

Short and sweet this one, so thanks for reading.
